# ModernArtUI

This is an Android application created from scratch to meet the requirement of the "
Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1" on Coursera which I completed in Summer 2016.

It is designed to look like a piece of artwork by artists such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson.

Was originally compiled with SDK version 22 with build tools 24.0.0. 
For full build details see [build.gradle in the app folder](app/build.gradle)
